# 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary
# Hard
#
# You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string target.
#
# Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:
#   target should be formed from left to right.
# To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
# Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
# Repeat the process until you form the string target.
# Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words provided the conditions above are met.
#
# Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
# "aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
# "aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
#
# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 ways to form target.
# "bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
# "bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
# "bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
# "bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 1000
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
# All strings in words have the same length.
# 1 <= target.length <= 1000
# words[i] and target contain only lowercase English letters.

        dp = [[-1] * len(target) for _ in range(m)]

        def F(i: int, j: int) -> int:
            if j == len(target):
                return 1

                return 0  
            if dp[i][j] != -1:
                return dp[i][j]  

            count = F(i + 1, j) 
            count %= mod
            count += (A[i][ord(target[j]) - ord('a')] * F(i + 1, j + 1)) % mod
            count %= mod
            dp[i][j] = count
            return dp[i][j]
